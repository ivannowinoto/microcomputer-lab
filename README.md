# x86-assembly-gcd-lcm
Using x86 Assembly Language (MS-DOS) to calculate the GCD and LCM of two integers.

This project was part of Microcomputer Lab. undergraduate course at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.

The program accepts two **2-digit decimal numbers** as input, calculates their **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** and **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**, and displays the result using MS-DOS interrupt functions.
